NSCharacterSet Utilities
************************
   Utilities for use with NSCharacterSet bitmap files.

   mkcharsets:	Creates the standard set of bitmap files for NSCharacterSet
		in the current directory.  Takes no argument ... it expects
		to read UnicodeData.txt in the current directory, and this
		file should be downloaded from mthe web (currently from 
		http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/)

   data2header: Takes the bitmaps produced by mkcharsets and generates a
		header file for use by NSCharacterSet.m ... which should
		be copied into core/base/Source.
		This contains two alternative representations of each
		characterset, one as a bitmap, and one as a list of ranges.

   ckcharset:	Takes filename of character set bitmap as argument and
		prints out the Unicode names of all of the characters in
		the character set.

You need to have installed the ucsdata library from dev-libs in order to
build these tools.
